          <h1>Madhubani Art</h1>
          <p>Madhubani art (also known as Mithila art) is a style of painting practiced in the Mithila region of India and Nepal. It is named after the Madhubani district of Bihar, India, which is where it originated.
This style of painting is characterized by its use of bright colors, geometric patterns, and stylized figures. Madhubani paintings are often used to decorate walls, floors, and furniture.
Madhubani paintings often depict scenes from Hindu mythology, nature, and daily life. They are typically created by women in the Mithila region and have been passed down through generations.</p>
