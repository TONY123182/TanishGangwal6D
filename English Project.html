<body bgcolor="cyan">
<p style="font-family:Arial;">Ila Sachani is known for her vigrant embroidery creation. She learned embroidery using feet instead of hands and is a 
very unique and creative artist. At first she faced many challenges, but with family support and lots of determination she overcame many challenges and has become an 
extraordinary artist.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial;">Ila Sachani was born in <b><u><mark>Moti Vavdi village in Bhavnagar, Gujarat</b></u></mark> in a farmer's family. From the 
very start, Ila's life was not easy because she was born with a condition that made her <b>hands hang loosely by her hands</i></b>. This meant that, unlike other children, she
could not use her hands in the same way. While other kids drew pictures in the sand or picked flower, Ila often wondered why she could not do the same things. She 
wanted to hold a piece of chalk like the other children and draw pictures on the slate, but she could not. Despite being born with this type of condition, Ila's 
mother and grandmother, skilled in <mark><u><b>Kathaiwar embroidery</mark></u></b>, taught her to embroider using her feet. With <b>determination</b>, Ila mastered threading 
needles and learned various embroidery styles beyond Gujarat.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial;">Initially creating designs for family and friends, Ila's talent soon gained local admiration and government 
recognition. Her work was showcased at state exhibitions, leading to national acclaim and prestigious awards, including the <mark><u><b>President's medal</mark></u></b>.<br></p>
