<p style="font-family:Arial; color:black;">Satellite technology is the humanmade objects that orbit the Earth to perform various functions,including:
<ul style="font-family:Arial;">
<li><b><u><p style="color:dark blue;">Communication</b></u>-Satellites can be used to connect to the internet via boardband data connections, especially in remote areas.</p>
<li><b><u><p style="color:dark blue;">Navigation</b></u>-Satellites like <mark><b>GPS</b></mark> use radio time signals to help mobile recievers determine their location.</p>
<li><b><u><p style="color:dark blue;">Weather Forecasting</b></u>-Satellites can monitor the Earth's weather and climate.</p></ul>

<p style="font-family:Arial; color:black;">India's economic process has made its space programme more visible and active as the country aims for greater self-reliance
in space technology.In 2008, India launched as many as 11 satellites, including nine from other countries, and went on to become the first nation to launch 10 
satellites on one rocket.India has also contibuted to satellite technology in many other ways, like:
<ul style="font-family:Arial;">
<li><b><u><p style="color:dark blue;">Satellite Constellations</b></u>-India has one of the largest constellations of operational remote sensing satellites.<mark><b> The Indian 
Remote Sensing[IRS]</b></mark> satellites are the largest collection of civillian remote sensing satellites in operation.
<li><b><u><p style="color:dark blue;">Satellite Systems</b></u>-The Indian National Satellite[INSAT] system revolutionized India's television,radio,telecommunications
and meteorlogical sectors.
<li><b><u><p style="color:dark blue;">Spacecraft missions</b></u>-<mark><b>The Indian Space Research Organization[ISRO]</b></mark> has carried out 125 spacecraft missions, including the 
<i>Gaganyaan,Lunar Pole, Exploration Mission, Chandrayaan-4, Shukrayaan, Mangalyaan-2</i>.India has launched 431 satellites for 34 countries.
</ul>
<p style="font-family:Arial; color:black;"><u><b>Some notable companies in India's space industry include Data Patterns [India] Ltd, Antrix Corporation, Godrej Aerospace,and
Larsen and Tourbo.</p></u></b>

<h2 style="text-align:left; color:green; font-family:Algerian;"><u>NAVIC Satellites</u></h2>
<p style="font-family:Arial; color:black;"><b><mark><u>Indian Regional Navigational Satellite System[IRNSS]</mark></u>, with an operational name of NAVIC[ acronym for Navigation with Indian
Constellation] is an autonomous regional satellite navigation system that provides accurate real-time positioning and timing services. The constellation is in orbit as
of 2018. NAVIC will provide two levels of service, the"standard positioning service", which will be open for civillian use, and a "restricted service" for authorised
users[including the miltary]. NAVIC satellites orbit the Earth and work together to provide coverage over the Indian subcontinent and up to 1,500 kilometers beyond.
NAVIC can be used for a variety of applications including the disaster management, vehicle tracking, mapping and more.</p><br></b>

<p style="font-family:Arial; color:black;">NAVIC [Navigation with Indian Constellation] satellites use a combination of atomic clocks,ground stations, and signal 
propagation time to navigate.<br>
<ul>
<li><b><u><p style="font-family:Arial;">Atomic Clocks</b></u>-NAVIC satellites have atomic clocks that serve as time references.<b><mark> The Space Application Centre</mark></b>-Ahmedabad developed the Rubidium atomic clock technology
used in NAVIC satellites.
<li><b><u><p style="font-family:Arial;">Ground Stations</b></u>-Ground stations continuosly monitor and calibrate the satellite clocks to maintain their accuracy.
<li><b><u><p style="font-family:Arial;">Signal Progation Time</b></u>-NAVIC users can determine their position by measuring the time it takes for signals to travel from the satellites to the ground recievers.</p>
</ul><br><br>


<p style="font-family:Arial; color:black;">NAVIC [Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System] helps with weather prediction and in weather forecasting in a variety
of ways,including-
<ul>
<li><b><u><p style="font-family:Arial;">Atmospheric data</b></u>-NAVIC provides atmospheric data that helps with weather predictions.
<li><b><u><p style="font-family:Arial;">Real-Time data</b></u>-Satellites can monitor and provide real-time data on atmospheric changes, such as the development of storms or clouds.
<li><b><u><p style="font-family:Arial;">Track storm movements</b></u>-Satellites can track storms movements and predict their path and intensity.
<li><b><u><p style="font-family:Arial;">Capturing images</b></u>-Satellites capture images of the weather.
<li><b><u><p style="font-family:Arial;">Measuring radiation levels</b></u>-Satellites can measure radiation levels.
<li><b><u><p style="font-family:Arial;">Detecting variations</b></u>-Satellites detect variations in the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
</ul>
