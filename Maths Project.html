<p style="font-family:Arial;"><b>Aryabhata was the first of the major mathematician-astronomers from the classical age of Indian 
mathematics and Indian astronomy. His works include the Āryabhaṭīya and the Arya-siddhanta. For his explicit mention of the relativity of motion, he
also qualifies as a major early physicist.Aryabhata (born <mark bgcolor="red"><b>476 AD</b></mark>, possibly Ashmaka or Kusumapura, India) was an astronomer and the earliest Indian 
mathematician whose work and history are available to modern scholars. He is also known as <mark><u><b>Aryabhata I </mark></u></b>or Aryabhata the Elder to 
distinguish him from a 10th-century Indian mathematician of the same name. He flourished in <mark>Kusumapura—near Patalipurta (Patna)</mark>.It is 
fairly certain that, at some point, he went to Kusumapura for advanced studies and lived there for some time. Both Hindu and Buddhist tradition, as
well as Bhāskara I (CE 629), identify Kusumapura as Pāṭaliputra, modern Patna. A verse mentions that Aryabhata was the head of an institution 
(kulapa) at Kusumapura, and, because the university of Nalanda was in Pataliputra at the time, it is speculated that Aryabhata might have been the 
head of the Nalanda university as well.Aryabhata is also reputed to have set up an observatory at the Sun temple in Taregana, Bihar.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial;">Aryabhatta made several contributions to Mathematics inventions and theories. Due to his significant contribution and 
achievement in mathematics, he is also called The King of Indian Mathematics. He was one of the first mathematicians to use zero as a number, and he 
also developed a system for representing numbers using decimal notation. Aryabhata’s algebra work helped lay the foundation for modern algebric 
methods. His work on geometry laid the foundations for modern analytical geometry. He is believed to have written the first book on mathematics in 
the world, called the <mark><u><i>Aryabhatiya</mark></u></i>. This book contains a lot of important mathematical concepts, such as algebra, arithmetic, and geometry. Aryabhata
also made significant contributions to astronomy, including calculating the value of pi.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial;">In Aryabhatiya, Aryabhata provided elegant results for the summation of series of squares and cubes.He developed the concept of zero by 
realising that the number zero can be used to represent the absence of a number.Decimal places: Aryabhatta invented the decimal system and used zero as a placeholder in 
mathematical equations. He names the first 10 decimal places and gives algorithms for obtaining square and cubic roots, using the decimal.Aryabhatta correctly calculated 
the areas of a triangle and of a circle. In Ganitapadam [poetic text talking about mathematics], he mentioned that “for a triangle, the result of a perpendicular with 
the half-side is the area.” Using the <mark><u><i>Pythagorean theorem</mark></i></u>, he obtained one of the two methods for constructing his table of sines. Aryabhatta's other contributions are-
Mathematical series, quadratic equations, compound interest (involving a quadratic equation), proportions (ratios), and the solution of various linear equations among the
arithmetic and algebraic topics.

<p style="font-family:Arial;">Aryabhatta, has received several honours from the government of India. Today, many ventures, schools, universities, and
satellites are named after the great scientist and mathematician, Aryabhatta.The Bihar Government created <mark><b><u>Aryabhatta Knowledge University (AKU)</u></mark></b> in 
Patna to develop and manage educational infrastructure linked to leadership, medical, technical, and associated professional education. Bihar State University Act of 
2008 governs the AKU university. Moreover, the government of India names India’s first satellite (Aryabhata and the lunar crater Aryabhata) after Aryabhatta to embrace
his contribution to astronomy and mathematics.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial;">Aryabhata died a successful mathematician, astronomer and scientist at the age of <u><i>74</i></u>. The place and time of death are still unknown. It 
was believed he spent most of his life in Kusumapura, Pataliputra.Aryabhatta’s contributions to mathematics and astronomy were phenomenal and influential. The discoveries 
and inventions made by the Aryabhatta turned out to be helpful in the science and mathematics fields. Aryabhatta’s contributions to mathematics like trigonometry, pi, 
place value system, etc. solve significant problems and are still practised and taught in schools and colleges.There are very few scientists who achieved in their lifetime 
an extraordinary duty of work and Aryabhata was one of them. India recognizes his contributions. His work was widely popular and appreciated in the Islamic world 
especially his astronomical discoveries which were translated into Arabic in the 8th Century.At the time, without any advanced technology available, being able to 
estimate and approximate his discoveries was truly remarkable.We must take pride in his works as Indians.</p>
